Hey everyone, welcome to this SuperCollider mini tutorial series. These videos will run in parallel with my main SuperCollider tutorials, in order to cover bite-size topics, like tips and tricks for improving your workflow, how to avoid common mistakes, syntax alternatives, understanding error messages, etc. In contrast to the main tutorial videos, which sometimes run pretty long, I'm going to commit to making each one of these mini tutorials 5 minutes or less. I'll keep an eye on the comments, so feel free to post thoughts or questions. I hope you find these mini tutorials super useful, if you do, please like and subscribe, and also, at the time of making this video, I've got a Patreon page for those who want to support these videos directly, which is patreon.com/elifieldsteel. Link in the video description. Thanks, and I'll see you in the next video.
